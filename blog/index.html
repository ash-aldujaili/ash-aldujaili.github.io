          </h1>

          <p class="post-meta">Jan 8, 2018</p>
        </header>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>In this post, we demonstrate the theoretical gurantee on the performance of the <strong>Weighted Majority Alogorithm</strong> (<em>WMA</em>) with empirical validation. WMA is one of the beautiful algorithms in the framework of online learning and sequential decision making under uncertainity.</p>

<p>First, let’s describe a setup where WMA can be used. Assume that a friend of yours challenges to a <strong>True or False</strong> quiz where you’re allowed to seek help / advice from $n$ advisors throughout the game.</p>

<p>With this challenge at hand, WMA helps you play the game such that the number of your mistakes is upper bounded by roughly twice the number of mistakes made by your best advisor, i.e., the least number of mistakes made among your $n$ advisors. In the next paragraph, we’ll see how you can use WMA in the game.</p>

<p>For each advisor $i$ and question (round) $t$, WMA associates a weight $w^t_i$. With $w^1_i=1\;, \forall i=1,\ldots, n.$ Assume the game has $T$ rounds. If advisor $i$ makes a mistake at round $t$, its weight is adjusted by a multiplicative factor $1-\eta$ where $\eta\in(0,1/2)$. That is, $w^{t+1}_i= (1-\eta) w^t_i$ if $i$ makes a mistake. Otherwise, $w^{t+1}_i=w^t_i$. At each round $t$, your decision is governed by the sum of weights of advisors who think the answer is <strong>True</strong> versus that of those who think the answer should be <strong>False</strong>. Mathematically, denote your answer at round $t$ by $y^t$, and the advisors’ answers by $x^t_i$. These variables take the values $0$ and $1$ to represent <em>True</em> and <em>False</em> respectively: we have</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">y^t = \mathbf{1}\big\{\sum_{i}x^t_i * w^t_i \geq \sum_{i} (1-x^t_i) * w^t_i \big\}</script>

<p>Let’s put WMA in action. Below, I have created $n$ advisors whose decisions at each round are based on tossing coins whose bias is sampled uniformly, $p_i\sim \mathcal{U}(0,1)$. Likewise, the game generates questions whose answers follows a Bernoulli distribution with $p_g\sim\mathcal{U}(0,1)$. We denote the correct answer at round $t$ by $z^t$. Also, let’s try to validate the theoretical bound on its performance. From <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos521/lecnotes/lec8.pdf">this</a>, after $\hat{t}$ rounds,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">|\text{your mistakes}| \leq 2 (1+ \eta)\;|\text{best_advisors_mistakes}|\; + \frac{2 \ln n}{\eta}</script>

<p>That is,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">2(1+\eta) \min(\sum_{t=0}^{\hat{t}}\mathbf{1}\{x^t_1 \neq z^t\}, \ldots, \sum_{t=0}^{\hat{t}}\mathbf{1}\{x^t_n \neq z^t\}) + \frac{2\ln n}{\eta}-  \sum_{t=0}^{\hat{t}} \mathbf{1}\{y^t\neq z^t\} \geq 0\;, \hat{t}= 1,\ldots, T</script>

<p>Let’s verify the above with the following 100 games with 1000 rounds each.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>import numpy as np

# let's try 100 games each with 1000 rounds,  
num_runs = 100
T = 1000

diff = np.zeros((num_runs, T))
for run in range(num_runs):
    n = np.random.randint(1,10)
    ps = np.random.random(n)
    ws = np.ones(n)
    p_g = np.random.random()
    eta = 0.25

    # your mistakes
    m = 0
    # advisors mistakes
    ms = np.zeros(n, dtype=np.int32)

    for t in range(T):
        # game correct answer
        z = np.random.random() &gt;= p_g
        # advisors answers
        xs = np.random.random(n) &gt;= ps
        # your answer
        y = np.sum(xs * ws) &gt;= np.sum((1-xs) * ws)

        # your mistakes
        m += (y != z)
        # advistors mistakes
        ms[xs != z] += 1

        # theoretical bound
        th_ub = 2 * (1+eta) * min(ms) + 2. * np.log(n) / eta
        diff[run, t] = th_ub - m
        
        # update weights
        ws[xs != z] = (1-eta) * ws[xs != z]


assert np.min(diff) &gt;= 0, "Theoretical gap should be non-negative"

<p>Our mistakes never exceeded the theoretical upper limit, as can be seen from the non-negative theoretical gap across all the runs and rounds of the game.</p>

          <p>In this post, we’ll take a quick tour into the sampling world and how it might be handy in some applications. Let’s start with some setup code.</p>

<h4>Sampling from an aribitrary 2-D distribution</h4>

<p>Let $x\in \mathbb{R}^2$ be a continuous random variable with from a probability distribution $q(x)$. We are interested in obtaining values that $x$ can take in a way that confirms to its probability distribution $q(x)$. Let’s assume $q(x)$ has the following form:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x\sim q(x)= \frac{1}{Z} [(x_1 - 0.5)^2 + (x_2 - 0.5)^2]\;,</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\frac{1}{Z} = \int^{1}_{0} (x_1 - 0.5)^2 dx_1+ \int^{1}_{0} (x_2 - 0.5)^2 dx_2 = \frac{1}{6}</script></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>q = lambda x: ((x[0] - 0.5)**2 + (x[1] - 0.5)**2) / 6.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Let’s have a look at how does this distribution look like</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>n = 100
x_1s, x_2s = np.meshgrid(*[np.linspace(0,1, n)]*2)

q_s = compute_q(x_1s, x_2s)
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.gca(projection='3d')
surf = ax.plot_trisurf(x_1s.ravel(), x_2s.ravel(), q_s.ravel(),

</p>

<p>The density accumulates at the boundaries of the distribution’s support. So when we sample, we expect more values around the boundaries rather than the center. The question is how to make our sampling process conforms to the same. In the rest of this post, we will discuss three methods: Rejection Sampling, Gibbs Sampling, Metropolis Hastings.</p>

<h3>Rejection Sampling:</h3>

<p>The gist of this method is to find a distribution $p(x)$ from which we know how to sample. We scale $p(x)$ by a factor $C$ such that 
<script type="math/tex">q(x) \leq C p(x)</script></p>

<p>If the above can be obtained, then our sampling procedure is as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Sample $\bar{x}\sim p(\bar{x})$.</li>
  <li>Toss a biased coin to accept $\bar{x}$ as a sample coming from $q$. The coin bias is $\frac{q(\bar{x})}{Cp(\bar{x})}$</li>
</ol>

<p>Intuitvely, you can think of this procedure as a correction scheme to account for the mismatch: how accurately $p(x)$ describes $q(x)$. Put it differently, the area under curve $Cp(x)$ is $C$, while under $q(x)$, it is $1$. And since $q(x)\leq Cp(x)$,  if we full the area under $Cp(x)$ with points uniformly, then $1/C$ of these points will be under $q(x)$.</p>

<p>In the demo below, we choose $p$ to be the uniform distribution:
<script type="math/tex">x_1 \sim \mathcal{U}(0,1)</script>
<script type="math/tex">x_2 \sim \mathcal{U}(0,1)</script>
<script type="math/tex">p(x) = 1</script></p>

<p>And $C$ to be $\max_{x} q(x)= 0.0833333$</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>C = q([0.,0.]) #max_x q(x)
p = lambda x: 1
samples = []
num_samples = 10000
while len(samples) &lt; num_samples:
    x = rnd.rand(2)
    if rnd.rand() &lt;= ( q(x) / (C * p(x))):
        samples.append({'x_1':x[0], 'x_2':x[1]})
    
</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>df = pd.DataFrame(samples)
_ = sns.jointplot(x=df.x_1, y=df.x_2, kind='kde')
</code></pre>
</div>

<br /><br />
</p>

<p>We can see how the histogram of the collected samples agrees to the mass distribution of $q$. However, this approach becomes challenging in higher dimensions: higher rejection probability $($which makes the process extremely slow$)$ and less known upper-bounding scaled distributions. For this, Markov Chain Monte Carlo $($MCMC$)$ methods come to the rescue</p>

<h3>Markov Chain Monte Carlo</h3>

<p>Based on the notion of stationary distribution,</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">\pi(\bar{x})=\sum_{x}\pi(x)T(\bar{x}|x)</script>
we can generate our samples from a dynamical systems over the states $($values$)$ which the random variable $x$ can take. That is, i. Specify a transition probability in line with the system dynamics $T(\bar{x}|x)$ $($or proposal distribution- to propose the next state $\bar{x}$ given the present state $x$ $)$. ii. Let the system interact, iii. The system will converge to the underlying $($unique$)$ distribution of $\pi$. Note that, if:
<script type="math/tex">T(\bar{x}|x)>0\;, \forall x, \bar{x}\;,</script>
there exists a unique stationary $\pi$</p>

<p>The challenge in this setup is how to define / sample from the valid transition distribution $($e.g., in higher dimensions$)$. Among other approaches we discuss two here.</p>

<h4>Gibbs Sampling</h4>

<p>Given a random $($initialized$)$ state of our systems variables $($here, $x_1$ and $x_2$$)$, one can condition one variable on the other to obtain a 1-D distriubution, which we assume we can sample from $($i.e., rejection sampling, central limit theorem, or other techniques$)$. Iteratively, we will obtain samples. Neverthelss, we need to give it some time till we converge to the stationary distribution of our system. In our example, we will make use of rejection sampling in 1-D to obtain our 1-D sample.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>
q = lambda x: ((x[0] - 0.5)**2 + (x[1] - 0.5)**2) / 6.
# q(x_1|x_2)
q_1 = lambda x: 6 * q(x)/((x[1]-0.5)**2 + 2. * 0.5**3 / 3.) 
# q(x_2|x_1)
q_2 = lambda x: 6 * q(x)/((x[0]-0.5)**2 + 2. * 0.5**3 / 3.) 
# p (upper bounding), here we are using uniform dist
p = lambda x: 1 

def reject_uniform_sample(q, C):
    while True:
        x_ = rnd.rand()
        if rnd.rand() &lt;= q(x_) /(C * 1.):
            return x_

# aribtrary value, by right we should use max_x q_1, max_x q_2
C_1 = 1.5
C_2 = 1.5
samples = [{'x_1':rnd.rand(), 'x_2': rnd.rand()}]
num_samples = 10000
while len(samples) &lt; num_samples:
    x_1 = reject_uniform_sample(lambda x_: q_1([x_, samples[-1]['x_2']]), C_1)
    x_2 = reject_uniform_sample(lambda x_: q_2([samples[-1]['x_1'], x_]), C_2)
    samples.append({'x_1':x_1, 'x_2':x_2})

<h4>Metropolis-Hastings Sampling</h4>

<p>In Gibbs sampling, the idea is to generate samples for each of our system’s variables from their posterior distribution with respect to the current values of the rest of the variables. Multi-dimensioanly sampling is reduced into a sequence of 1-D sampling procedures. We saw above, this approach might be a little bit slow and generates highly correlated samples $($again: we are generating samples that are highly probable given the past values of the rest of the variables$)$. Furthermore, what if we can’t compute nor sample from the posterior distribution. Can we propose transitions from one state to another arbitrarily and sitll converge? The idea of MH-sampling is to incorporate rejection sampling with aribtrary proposal distribution such that the transition probability $($which uniquely defines the Markov process$)$ can be constructed.</p>

<p>Let’s step back and summarise the above:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>We would like to sample from our system’s distribution <script type="math/tex">q( x )</script>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>We are using Markov Chain $($process$)$ to simulate our system of random variables. That is the Markov chain asymptotically converges to a stationary distribution <script type="math/tex">\pi(x)</script> and which is <script type="math/tex">q(x)</script>.</li>
  <li>To converge to $ q(x) $, we need to construct the corresponding chain’s transition probability $ T(\bar{x}|x) $
 because it uniquely defines the process and hence its stationary distribution.</li>
  <li>One way of achieving that is through the detailed balance, sufficient but not a necessary condition:
$ q(x) T(\bar{x}|x) = q(\bar{x}) T(x|\bar{x}) $</li>
</ol>

<p>We can make use of the above formula to construct a transition probability  that is a product of an arbitrary distribution 
$g(\bar{x}|x)$ 
, which is referred to as the proposal distribution as mentioned above, and the acceptance distribution 
$A(\bar{x}|x)$</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">T(\bar{x}|x)= g(\bar{x}|x)A(\bar{x}|x)</script>

<p>Plugging this in the detailed balance condition, we have:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A(\bar{x}|x)=\min\{1, \frac{q(\bar{x})g(x|\bar{x})}{q(x)g(\bar{x}|x)}\}</script>

<p>Let’s see how we can realize this in code: Let’s define our</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">g(\bar{x}|x)\sim \mathcal{N}(x,0.25I)</script>

<p>and here we are assuming that we can sample efficiently from this 2-D Gaussian distribution $($ otherwise, we may use one of the techniques above as rejection sampling $)$. Notice here, there is nothing preventing us from sampling outside the support of $q(x)$, so we need to explicitly state that. I.e., $q(x)=0$ outside $q$’s support. Also, our choice of proposal distribution might affect the convergence progress.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code># target distribution (the one we'd like the MC to converge to)

<p>In this short post, we show why the covariance matrix $\Sigma \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ of a multivariate Gaussian $\vx\in\mathbb{R}^n$ is always symmetric positive definite. That is,</p>

<ol>
  <li>for all non-zero vector $\vy \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $\vy^T\Sigma \vy&gt;0$</li>
  <li>$\Sigma_{ij} = \Sigma_{ji}$.</li>
</ol>

<p>The latter condition $(2)$ follows from the definition of the covariance matrix and the commutative property of multiplication. For condition $(1)$, we can prove it in two steps:</p>

<p>First, for all non-zero vector $\vy \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $\vy^T\Sigma \vy \geq 0$. This follows from
<script type="math/tex">{\vx}^T\Sigma \vx=\sum_{ij} y_i y_j \Sigma_{ij}=\sum_{ij}y_i y_j E[(x_i - \bar{x}_i)(x_j - \bar{x}_j)]=E\big[\sum_{ij}y_i y_j (x_i - \bar{x}_i)(x_j - \bar{x}_j)\big]\;,</script>
with $z_i =x_i - \bar{x}_i$, we have <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\vx^T\Sigma \vx=E[\sum_{ij} y_i z_iy_jz_j]=E[\sum_{i} y^2_iz^2_i + 2 \sum_{i<j} y_iz_i y_j z_j]=E[(\vy^T\vz)^2]\geq 0\;, %]]></script> since $(\vy^T\vz)^2\geq 0$.</p>

<p>Second, for $\Sigma$ to hold as a covariance matrix for a multivariate Gaussian, it must be invertible. That is to say, its rank is $n$, i.e., $n$ non-zero eigenvalues ${\lambda_i }_{1\leq i \leq n}$ which are also positive $($from step 1$)$. This means that all non-zero vectors $\vx \in \mathbb{R}^n$ can be written as linear combinations of $\Sigma$’s eigen vectors 
<script type="math/tex">\{\mathbf{v}_i\}_{1\leq i \leq n}\;.</script></p>

<p>Therefore, <script type="math/tex">{\vx}^T \Sigma \vx= \sum_{ij} w_i \mathbf{v}^T_i \lambda_j w_j \mathbf{v}_j= \sum_{i} \lambda_i w^2_i > 0\;.</script></p>

          <p>In this post, we show how Linear Algebra can be used to solve one of the common optimization problems that arise in a variety of domains. In particular, we are interested in the quadratic optimization problem of the form

\newcommand{\vq}{\mathbf{q}}

$</p>

<p>\begin{align}
\text{max}_{\vx}\hspace{1.15cm} \vx^TA\vx \newline
\hspace{1em}\text{s.t.}\hspace{1em} \norm{\vx}=1
\label{eq:opt-problem}
\end{align}</p>

<p>where $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$ is a real symmetric $($square$)$ matrix, $\vx\in\mathbb{R}^n$. An optimal solution of this problem is $\vq_1\in\mathbb{R}^n$, the eigenvector that corresponds to $\lambda_1\in \mathbb{R}$, the largest eigenvalue of $A$.</p>

<p>Now that we have defined the problem, let’s try to solve it by making use of Linear Algebra, from which we know the following.</p>

<ol>
  <li>If $Q\in\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$ is an orthogonal matrix, then $Q^{T}Q=QQ^T=I_n$ where $I_n\in\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$ is the $n\times n$ identity matrix.</li>
  <li>Columns (and rows) of an orthogonal matrix have unit norm.</li>
  <li>Any real symmetric matrix $A$ can be decomposed into $Q\Lambda Q^T$, where $Q\in\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$ is an orthogonal matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of $A$, while $\Lambda = diag(\mathbf{\lambda})$ is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are the eign values of $A$ such that $\lambda_1\geq \lambda_2 \geq \cdots\geq \lambda_n$ and  $\lambda_i$ is the eigenvalue of the $i^{th}$ column of $Q$.</li>
</ol>

<p>From (3.), one can write $\vx^TA\vx$ as $\vx^T Q\Lambda Q^T \vx \leq \lambda_1 \vx^T QI_n Q^T \vx$. Based on (1.) and the constraint of $\vx$’s unit norm, the last term can further be simplified to have $\vx^TA\vx \leq \lambda_1 \norm{\vx}\leq \lambda_1$.</p>

<p>On the one hand, we found that $\max_{\vx} \vx^T A \vx = \lambda_1$. On the other hand, $A\vq_1 = \lambda_1\vq_1$, and thus $\vq_1^TA\vq_1 = \lambda_1$. Therefore, $\vq_1 \in \arg\max_{\vx} \vx^T A \vx$.</p>

<p>Matrix inversion is a handy procedure in solving a linear system of equations based on the notion of identity matrix $I_n\in\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$ whose all entries are zero except the entries along the main diagonal.</p>

<p>For a linear system $A\vx=\vb$ where $A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ is a known matrix, $\vb\in\mathbb{R}^m$ is a known vector, and $\vx\in\mathbb{R}^n$ is a vector of unknown values, one can find a solution if a matrix $B\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}$ can be found such that $BA=I_n$ since for all $\vx \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $I_n \vx=\vx$. We refer to $B$ as the inverse of $A$ $($commonly denoted as $A^{-1})$. Mathematically,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A\vx=\vb</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A^{-1}A\vx=A^{-1}\vb</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">I_n\vx=A^{-1}\vb</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\vx=A^{-1}\vb</script>

<p>Of course, such solution can be found if $A$ is invertible. That is it is possible to find $A^{-1}$. I am writing this post to summarize possible scenarios one may face when inverting a matrix.</p>

<p>Before delving into the details, I intend to present a geometric view of linear systems of equations. This will help us understand why we could have exactly one, infinitely many, or no solution at all. And subsequently, why some matrices are invertible and others are not.</p>

<h3>Problem Setup</h3>
<p>One can think of $\vb$ as a point in the $m$-dimensional space. Furthermore, consider $A\vx$ as a linear combination $A$’s column vectors where the $i^{th}$ column $A_{:,i}$ is scaled by the $i^{th}$ entry of $\vx$, $x_i$. In other words, when we say that $\vb=A\vx$, we mean that $\vb$ is reachable from the origin $(\mathbf{0}\in\mathbb{R}^m)$ by moving $x_1$ units along the vector $A_{:,1}$, $x_2$ units along the vector $A_{:,2}$, …, and $x_n$ units along the vector $A_{:,n}$. For different $\vx\in\mathbb{R}^n$, we may reach different points in the $m$-dimensional space. The set of such points are referred to as the <strong>span</strong> of $A$ $($or <strong>range</strong> of $A$, <strong>column space</strong> of $A)$. That is, the set of points reachable by a linear combination of $A$’s columns. Mathematically, <script type="math/tex">span(A\text{'s columns})=\{b\in \mathbb{R}^m|\; b = A\vx,\; \vx\in \mathbb{R}^n\}\;.</script></p>

<p>Therefore, a solution exists for $A\vx=\vb$ if $\vb\in span(A\text{‘s columns})$. A necessary and sufficient condition for a solution to exist for all possible values of $\vb$ $(\mathbb{R}^m)$ is that $A$’s columns constitute at least one set of $m$ linearly independent vectors. Let’s note that there is no set of $m$-dimensional vectors has more than $m$ linearly indepdent vectors. The following examples provide an illustration.</p>

<ol>
  <li>$A=\mat{\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2 , 0 &amp; 0\end{array}}$,  $\vb =\mat{\begin{array}{c} 1 , 1\end{array}}$. In this example, $A$’s span is $\mathbb{R}^1$ along the vector $\mat{\begin{array}{c}1 , 0\end{array}}$ and no matter how $\vx$ is set, we can not reach $\vb$, because it does not lie at the intersection of its plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $A$’s space. With regard to the remark made above, we notice that $m=2$, but we do not have $2$ linearly independent vectors in $A$’s columns.</li>
  <li>$A=\mat{\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2 , 0 &amp; 0\end{array}}$,  $\vb =\mat{\begin{array}{c} 1 , 0\end{array}}$. In this example, $A$ is the same as $(1.)$’s but we moved $\vb$ to make it reachable. One may note that the effective dimension of the problem at hand is one (the second entry of all the columns is zero). In other words, we have matrix of $1\times 2$ with $m=1$ and we have $2$ linearly dependent vectors of length 1 that can reach $\vb$ through any solution that satisfies $x_1+ 2x_2=1$, for which there are infinitely many. Such example fulfills the sufficient and necessary condition aforementioned, but here we have more than $m$ columns. Thus, there are infinitely many solutions rather than exactly one.</li>
  <li>$A=\mat{\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0 , 0 &amp; 1\end{array}}$,  $\vb =\mat{\begin{array}{c} 1 , 1\end{array}}$. In this example, we made $A$ spans $\mathbb{R}^2$ with exactly $m=2$ linearly indepdendent vectors, and so we can reach $\vb$ with exactly one particular $\vx$. This example fulfils the sufficient and necessary condition with exactly $n=m$ columns.</li>
</ol>

<p>Based on the above, one can conclude the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>When $A$ is a square matrix $(m=n)$ with $m$ mutually independent column vectors, there is exactly one solution for any $\vb\in\mathbb{R}^{m}$. Thus, $A$ is invertible.</li>
  <li>
    <p>When $A$ is a square matrix $(m=n)$ with linearly depdenent column vectors, there exists some $\vb$ for which no solution exists. Thus, $A$ is non-invertible and we say that $A$ is a <strong>singular matrix</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When $A$ is a rectangular matrix $(m&gt;n)$, there exists some $\vb$ for which no solution exists. Thus, $A$ is non-invertible, and we say that the system is <strong>overdetermined</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When $A$ is a rectangular matrix $(m&lt; n)$ with $m$ linearly indendent column vectors, there exist infinitely many solutions for any $\vb \in \mathbb{R}^m$. Thus, $A$ is non-invertible, and we say that the system is <strong>underdetermined</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>When $A$ is a rectangular matrix $(m&lt; n)$ with $&lt; m$ linearly indendent column vectors, it is possible that there exists some $\vb$ for which no solution exists. Thus, $A$ is non-invertible. We still say the system is <strong>underdetermined</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are several procedures to compute $A^{-1}$ for invertible matrices such as the Gauss elimination method $($some others are listed in the figure at the bottom of this page$)$.</p>

<h3>Non-Invertible Matrices</h3>

<p>So what do we do when $A$ is non-invertible and we are still interested in finding a solution for a system? Well, we can use a pseudo-inverse matrix with some compromise on the solution’s quality as follows.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If there is <strong>no solution</strong>. That is we can’t reach $\vb$ and the system is overdetermined. Then, we can choose one with the least squares error. Mathematically,</li>
</ul>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\min_{\vx} ||A\vx-b||^2_2</script>

<p>Differentiating w.r.t $\vx$ and setting it to zero,</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">0=\nabla_{\vx}{((A\vx-b)^{T}(A\vx-b))}=A^{T}A\vx-A^T\vb</script>
yields $\vx=(A^{T}A)^{-1}A^T\vb$. Therefore, the pseudo-inverse matrix is $(A^{T}A)^{-1}A^T$</p>

<ul>
  <li>If there are <strong>infinitely many solutions</strong>. That is the system is underdetermined. Then, one can choose one with the minimum norm. Mathematically,</li>
</ul>

<p><script type="math/tex">\min_{\vx} ||\vx||^2_2</script> 
<script type="math/tex">\text{s.t.}\;\;\; A\vx =\vb</script></p>

<p>With the Lagrangian multipliers trick, the above can be solved as follows.</p>

<p>Differentiating w.r.t $\vx$ and setting it to zero,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">0=\nabla_{\vx}{(\vx^{T}\vx - \mathbf{\lambda}^{T}(A\vx-b))}= 2\vx - A^{T}\mathbf{\lambda}</script>

<p>$A^{T}$ is not invertible, but $AA^{T}$ is.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Therefore, we can solve for $\mathbf{\lambda}$ as follows.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbf{\lambda}= 2(AA^T)^{-1}A\vx=2(AA^T)^{-1}\vb</script>

<p>Thus, $\vx=A^T(AA^T)^{-1}\vb$</p>

<p>Interestingly, both of the above pseudo-inverses are equivalent to the <strong>Moore-Penrose</strong> pseudo-inverse which can be computed from the singular value decomposition $($SVD$)$.</p>

<h3>Ill-Conditioned Matrices</h3>

<p>Let’s motivate this issue with an example. Assume you are reading a measurement, which you have to scale by dividing by a very small number. If your reading deviates a little, the absolute error will extremely large. Such large oscillations might be undesirable and we’d like to dampen them. In the matrix world, dividing by a small number corresponds to to multiplying by the inverse of an ill-conditioned matrix. An ill-conditioned matrix is still <strong>invertible</strong>, but it is numerically unstable. In addition to the measurement error $($here the measurement is captured by $\vb$$)$, inverting an ill-conditioned matrix also suffers from loss of precision in floating point arithmetic.To cope with this unstability, we compromise the quality of the solution and use regularization techniques to have a stable numerical outcome. The bulk of these techniques aim to increase $($or replace$)$ the value of the smallest eigenvalue with respect to the greatest eigenvalue. Common techniques are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Truncated SVD</li>
  <li>Tikhonov Regularization $($which can also be used for non-invertible matrices$)$.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is important to consider the regularization effect on the final solution and whether it makes sense to our system or not.</p>

      <p>$AA^T$ is a square matrix. What is left to show is that columns of $AA^T$ are linearly independent, and thus $AA^T$ is invertible. We know that the columns of $A^T$ are linearly independent,  which means its null space is ${\mathbf{0}}$. By contradiction, let’s assume that $\mathbf{v}$ is a non-zero vector that belongs to  $AA^T$’s null space, which means $AA^T \mathbf{v}= \mathbf{0}$. Mutiplying both sides by $\mathbf{v}$ yields $(A^T \mathbf{v})^{T}(A^T \mathbf{v})=0$, i.e., $A^T \mathbf{v}= \mathbf{0}$. This contradicts the fact that $A^T$’s null space is the zero vector. Therefore, $\mathbf{v}$ can not be zero and $AA^T$’s null space has no non-zero vector, and all of its columns are linearly independent.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
