Consider the figure below. We have a point in the $\mathbf{y}$ in the lower dimensional space $\mathcal{Y}$ that is projected randomly to the higher dimensional space $\mathcal{X}$ twice using two randomly sampled matrices $A_p$ and $A_q$. With this setting at hand, we are interested in the following question: is there a relation between the function values at $A_p\mathbf{y}$ and $A_q\mathbf{y}$. This has been addressed in [1, Theorem I]. Here, we provide a numerical validation of [1]’s result besides reiterating the formal proof. Before we delve into this further, let’s introduce some notation in accordance with [1].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Notation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Theorem I [1]&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been shown in [1] that the mean variation in the objective value for a point $\mathbf{y}$ in the low-dimensional
space $\mathcal{Y} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ projected randomly into the decision space $\mathcal{X}\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ of Lipschitz-continuous
problems is &lt;strong&gt;bounded&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mathematically, for all $\mathbf{y} \in \mathcal{Y}$, we have
&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\mathbb{E}[|g_p(\mathbf{y}) − g_q(\mathbf{y})|] \leq \sqrt{8} \cdot L 
\cdot ||\mathbf{y}||\;.&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we reproduce [1]’s proof for completeness, then we validate the theorem numerically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Proof&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Numerical Validation&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, we carry out a numerical validation of [1]’s Theorem I over four popular Lipschitz-like benchmark functions $($namely, Cigar, Sphere, Rastrigin, and Bohachevsky$)$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we sampled 100 points $\mathbf{y}\in\mathcal{Y}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ whose norms span the range $[0,1]$. E.g., with $d=1$, $\mathbf{y}\in[-1,1]$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, each of these 100 points are projected to the function space $\mathcal{X}\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ using 20 random matrices ${A_p}_{1\leq p\leq 20}$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, the four considered functions are evaluated at these random projections. Note that for each of these functions, $100*20$ function evaluations are performed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourth, we average over the absolute difference between function values at projections of the same point $\mathbf{y}$. That is, for each of the 100 points, we compute the mean of $\frac{20*20- 20}{2}=190$ values, each of which representing the absolute difference of the function value at two random projections of the corresponding point $\mathbf{y}$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifth, the computed average values are plotted as a function of the  corresponding point $\mathbf{y}$ in Figure 1. One can see how the trend of the plot follows the curve of $||\mathbf{y}||$ in accordance with [1]’s Theorem I.&lt;/p&gt;

In general, this approach models the objective and constraint functions with stochastic processes based on a few evaluations at points in the search space; with the goal of predicting the functions’ behavior as we move away from the evaluated points by different amounts in each coordinate direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stochastic process approach has been used in several fields under such names as ‘kriging’, ‘Bayesian optimization’, and ‘random function approach’. It comes with two main advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Suitability for Expensive Optimization - as it quickly captures the trends over the search space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ease of establishing reasonable stopping rules - as it provide statistical confidence intervals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Modelling Alternatives&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say we have evaluated a deterministic function,  $~y:\mathbb{R}^k\to \mathbb{R}$, at $n$ points. In other words, we have a sample $\mathcal{D}={(x^{(i)},y^{(i)})}_{1\leq i \leq n}$ 
from the $k$-dimensional space, and we would like to use these observation in guiding our search for the optimal point. Let’s explore possible models that may help us in that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Linear Regression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can use linear regression as a simple way to fit a response surface to $\mathcal{D}$. In linear regression, the observations are assumed to be generated from the following model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
y(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) = \sum_{h} \beta_{h}f_h(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) + \epsilon^{(i)}\; (i = 1,\ldots,n).
\label{eq:lin-reg}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above equation, the $f_h(\mathbf{x})$’s are a set of linear or non-linear functions of $\mathbf{x}$; the $\beta_h$’s are unknown parameters of the model to be estimated; and the $\epsilon^{(i)}$’s are independent error terms with a normal distribution of zero mean and $\sigma^2$ variance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Employing Eq. \ref{eq:lin-reg} has two main concerns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Conceptual Concern: Our function $f$ is deterministic. Therefore, any improper fit of Eq. \ref{eq:lin-reg} will be a modelling error—i.e., incomplete regression term $\sum_{h} \beta_{h}f_h(\mathbf{x}^{(i)})$—rather than measurement noise or error—i.e., the $\epsilon^{(i)}$ term. In essence $\epsilon^{(i)}=\epsilon(\mathbf{x}^{(i)})$ captures the value of the left-out regression terms at $\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$. And if $y(\mathbf{x})$ is continuous, then $\epsilon(\mathbf{x})$ is continuous as well. Thus, if two points $\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$ and $\mathbf{x}^{(j)}$ are close, then the errors $\epsilon(\mathbf{x}^{(i)})$ and $\epsilon(\mathbf{x}^{(j)})$ should be close as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Practical Concern: How to define the $f_h$’s functions. Indeed, if we knew the perfect form of Eq. \ref{eq:lin-reg}, our function $f$ would not have been a black box in the first place. One can certainly employ a meta-model $($some referred to it as flexible functional form$)$ approach to decide the most suitable form of Eq. \ref{eq:lin-reg}. However, this approach comes with an additional set of parameters $($hyperparameters$)$ and requires many more function evaluations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of the above concerns, it makes no sense to assume that the error terms $\epsilon^{(i)}$’s are independent. Alternatively, we can assume that these terms are associated / related and that the level of such association $($correlation$)$ is low when the corresponding points $\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$’s are far away and high when they are close. The following equation captures this assumption of correlation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
Corr[\epsilon(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}),\epsilon(\mathbf{x}^{(j)})] = \exp\big(- \sum_{h=1}^{k} \theta_h |x^{(j)}_h-x^{(j)}_h|^{p_h}\big)\;, \theta_h \geq 0\;, p_h \in [0,1]\;.
\label{eq:corr-fct}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parameters $\theta_h$’s and $p_h$’s controls how fast the degree of correlation changes between two errors terms as the (weighted) distance between the corresponding points changes as shown in the figure below. In general, $\theta_h$ measures the importance / activity of the $h^{th}$ variable $x_h$ $($the higher $\theta_h$ is, the faster the correlation drops as the corresponding points move away in the coordinate direction $h)$, while $p_h$ captures the function smoothness in the coordinate direction $h$ $(p_h$ = 2 is for smooth functions$)$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
  Figure 1. Correlation Function $($Eq. \ref{eq:corr-fct}$)$ with different parameters.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having modelled the correlation between our observations, fitting the regression term to our observations is less of a concern now. In fact, this forms the basis of the stochastic process model presented next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;DACE&lt;/strong&gt; $($Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments [1]$)$&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the correlation model $($Eq. \ref{eq:corr-fct}$)$, one can view the
error term $\epsilon(\mathbf{x})$ as a stochastic process - a set of correlated random variables indexed by the $k$-dimensional space of $\mathbf{x}$. Therefore, the observations can be modeled with the following stochastic process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
y^{(i)} = \mu + \epsilon(\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\; (i=1, \ldots, n).
\label{eq:dace}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison to Eq. \ref{eq:lin-reg}, $\mu$ $($the mean of the stochastic process$)$ is the simplest regression term $($ a constant $)$; $\epsilon(\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ with a correlation given by Eq. \ref{eq:corr-fct}. This model is commonly referred to as &lt;strong&gt;DACE&lt;/strong&gt; - an acronym to the paper that popularized it [1].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can estimate DACE’s $2k+2$ parameters by maximizing the likelihood of our sample $\mathcal{D}$. With the correlation between two error terms defined as above, the vector $\mathbf{y}=[y^{(1)},\ldots, y^{(n)}]$ of observed function values is a normal random $n$-vector. That is, $\mathbf{y}\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2\mathbf{R})$. Thus, the likelihood function of our samples can be written as follows.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#myfootnote1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;\begin{equation}
f(\mathbf{y};\theta,p, \mu, \sigma) = 
\frac{1}
{(2\pi)^{n/2}(\sigma^2)^{n/2}|\mathbf{R}|^{(1/2)}}
\exp\big(-\frac{(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{1}\mu)^{T} \mathbf{R}^{-1} (\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{1}\mu)}{2\sigma^2}\big)
\label{eq:likelihood}
\end{equation}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eq. $\ref{eq:likelihood}$ can be optimized with respect to $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ in closed form by taking the partial derivative of its log:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\hat{\mu}=\frac{\mathbf{1}^{T}\mathbf{R}^{-1}\mathbf{y}}{\mathbf{1}^{T}\mathbf{R}^{-1}\mathbf{1}}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{1}\hat{\mu})^{T} \mathbf{R}^{-1} (\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{1}\hat{\mu})}{n}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;myfootnote1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;: Make use of: $det(cA)= c^n det(A)$, where A is an $n\times n$-matrix; $Cov[x^{(i)},x^{(j)}] = \sigma^2 \cdot Corr[x^{(i)},x^{(j)}]$; and the multivariate normal probability density function.&lt;/p&gt;
